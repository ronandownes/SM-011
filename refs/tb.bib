A hyperface, sandwiched between two d-simplices, is said to be locally Delaunay if no vertex of the two d-simplices lies inside the circumsphere of either d-simplex. (It is the apex of each d-simplex, not shared by the other d-simplex, that matters.) If a triangulation is Delaunay, every hyperface of the triangulation is locally Delaunay. Conversely, if every hyperface of a triangulation is locally Delaunay, then the triangulation is Delaunay (i.e. every simplex is Delaunay). Delaunay himself [13] was the first to make this observation.},

Thus, like alpha-shape but only one oring that is guaranteed to be simple and bound all points of the input set. Rather simple really.},

-has the ability to look past a local neighbourhood through topology defined by graph.

How does it work: builts a graph from a delaunay triangulation with added diagonals, edges are then removed if the height span is larger than a treshold. Now only points in the largest connected component are kept, smaller connected components are regarded to as noise.},

	Abstract = {This paper reviews LiDAR ground filtering algorithms used in the process of creating Digital Elevation Models. We discuss critical issues for the development and application of LiDAR ground filtering algorithms, including filtering procedures for different feature types, and criteria for study site selection, accuracy assessment, and algorithm classification. This review highlights three feature types for which current ground filtering algorithms are suboptimal, and which can be improved upon in future studies: surfaces with rough terrain or discontinuous slope, dense forest areas that laser beams cannot penetrate, and regions with low vegetation that is often ignored by ground filters.},
