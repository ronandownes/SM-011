\section{OL LC}

– check a result by considering whether
it is of the right order of magnitude
and by working the problem
backwards; round off a result
– accumulate error (by addition or
subtraction only)
– make and justify estimates and
approximations of calculations;
calculate percentage error and
tolerance
– calculate average rates of change (with
respect to time)
– solve problems that involve
• calculating cost price, selling price,
loss, discount, mark up (profit as a
% of cost price), margin (profit as a
% of selling price)
• compound interest, depreciation
(reducing balance method), income
tax and net pay (including other
deductions)
• costing: materials, labour and
wastage
• metric system; change of units;
everyday imperial units (conversion
factors provided for imperial units)
– make estimates of measures in the
physical world around them
