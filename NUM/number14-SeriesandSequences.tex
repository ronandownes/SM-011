\chapter{Series and sequences}

– appreciate that processes can generate
sequences of numbers or objects
– investigate patterns among these
sequences
– use patterns to continue the sequence
– generalise and explain patterns and
relationships in algebraic form
– recognise whether a sequence is
arithmetic, geometric or neither
– find the sum to n terms of an arithmetic
series
