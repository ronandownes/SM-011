# Computational modelling of terrains

The book *Computational modelling of terrains* presents an overview of algorithms and methodologies to reconstruct, manipulate, and extract information from terrains.

It covers different representations of terrains (eg TINs, rasters, point clouds, contour lines) and presents techniques to handle large datasets.

## Open material
This book is the bundle of the lecture notes that we ([@hugoledoux](https://github.com/hugoledoux/), [@kenohori](https://github.com/kenohori/), [@ylannl](https://github.com/ylannl/)) wrote for the course [Digitial terrain modelling (GEO1015)](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo1015/) in the [MSc Geomatics at the Delft University of Technologies](http://geomatics.tudelft.nl) in the Netherlands.
The course is tailored for MSc students who have already followed an introductory course in GIS and in programming (in Python).

Each chapter is a lesson in the course, and each [lesson](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo1015/les/) is accompanied by a video introducing the key ideas and/or explaining some parts of the lessons.
